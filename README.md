GitHub emoji expansion in OS X
=============================
Add GitHub emoji codes to OS X's symbol and text substitution.

This project contains a plist that is suitable to import into OS X's text substitution pref pane and the code used to generate it.

Install
-------

1. (optional) Back up your existing custom text substitution rules:
```bash
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -x -c "Print NSUserReplacementItems" ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist > backup.plist
```

2. Initialize NSUserReplacements:
  - Go to System Preferences > Language & Text > Text
  - Click the "Restore Defaults" button
  - Make sure "Use symbol and text substitution" is checked 

3. Download and install the GitHub emoji expansion plist
```bash
curl -O https://raw.github.com/gregburek/github-emoji-expansion-in-osx/master/NSUserReplacementItems.plist
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Merge '`pwd`/NSUserReplacementItems.plist' NSUserReplacementItems" ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist
```
4. (optional) Restore your previous custom text substitution rules:
```bash
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Merge '`pwd`/backup.plist' NSUserReplacementItems" ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist
```
5. (optional) Enable text replacement in all apps by default:
```bash
defaults write -g WebAutomaticTextReplacementEnabled -bool true
```

6. Logout of your user account and log back in for the changes to take effect.

Develop
-------
The generation script has been tested on Ruby versions 1.9.2-p290 and 1.9.3-p327 and I recommend developing the project in a similar environment as unicode support in 1.8 is not best.
Install dependencies locally by running `bundle install`. To regenerate the `NSUserReplacementItems.plist` file, run `bundle exec ruby generate_plist.rb`

Caveats
----
- Emoji listed below are not included in this plist and ignored by the generation script. Some rely on multi-part unicode like [Regional Indicator Symbols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Indicator_Symbol), and supporting them would require a minor refactor. Others are just special :smile:
- Emoji present in Github but not in unicode:
